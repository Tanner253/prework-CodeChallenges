Perfect Sequences
A perfect sequence is a sequence such that all of its elements are non-negative integers and the product of all of them is equal to their sum. For example: [2,2], [1,3,2] and [0,0,0,0] are perfect sequences and [4,5,6] and [0,2,-2] are not perfect sequences. Negative numbers of any kind are not valid in a perfect sequence
